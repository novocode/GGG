Player Choice: ?

Board setup:
	1. Outer Walls & floor
	2. Placement of Cities
	3. Resources on ALL floor tiles
	4. Prim's Algorithm to clear some resources.
		a. This will allow a path between all cities and resources
		
	1 Start with a grid full of resources.
    2 Pick a cell, mark it as part of the maze. Add the resources of the cell to the resource list.
    3 While there are resources in the list:
        a Pick a random resource from the list. If only one of the two cells that the resource divides is visited, then:
            i Make the resource a passage and mark the unvisited cell as part of the maze.
            ii Add the neighboring resources of the cell to the resource list.
        b Remove the resource from the list.
		
	Problems:
		1. Based on the Hexagonal Grid, how do I determine that (5,1), (4,2), (3,3), (2,4), (1,5) are outerwalls? Especially when Length varies. - DONE
		2. Prim has function to handle unvisitedDirections 
			a. Need to translate that to Unity
		3. Need to merge Direction script with Hexagonal Grid... somehow
		4. Need to determine neighboring tiles with each other, for their example grid.neighbor()
		5. Need to add unvisited neighbors to priorityQueue.
		6. Translate all into Unity code
